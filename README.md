# Overview
This project is a simple Docker image that runs the [Charles Proxy](http://www.charlesproxy.com/).

# Prerequisites
* a working [Docker](http://docker.io) engine
* a working [Docker Compose](http://docker.io) installation

# Building
Type `docker-compose build` to build the image.

# Installation
Docker will automatically install the newly built image into the cache.

# Tips and Tricks

## Launching The Image

`docker-compose up` will launch the image allowing you to begin working on projects. The Docker Compose file is 
configured to mount your home directory into the container.  

# Troubleshooting

## User Account
The image assumes that the account running the continer will have a user and group id of 1000:1000.  This allows the container 
to save files in your home directory and keep the proper permissions.

## X-Windows
If the image complains that it cannot connect to your X server, simply run `xhost +` to allow the container to connect 
to your X server.
